/*
Show how to modify the addfrac.c program of Section 3.2 so that the user 
is allowed to enter fractions that contain spaces before and after each / character.

Add a space after the first %d for each scanf statement. This will allow pattern 
matching for whitespace between the two %ds and the / character.
